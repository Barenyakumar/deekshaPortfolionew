            <p class="about__description">
             Back in 2014, the Indian government introduced the “Swachh Bharat” mission urging the citizens to spread the idea of cleanliness through the length and breadth the nation. Inspired by the Prime minister’s vision of a clean India, the reputed organisation “Adani act” initiated the “Swacchagraha Project”  to implement health and hygiene in schools.
In the year 2018, the Swacchagraha project was successfully launched in our school. It was undertaken by a group of twenty-five called “the Swacchagraha Dal” comprising the Dal detectives, designers, reporters and meeting organisers. The project involved a multitude of intensive activities aiming at creating a clean and green environment in the school. 
The Oath for a clean India
Our operation began by undertaking the cleanliness pledge with more than 1000 students and staff in the school. 
GREEN TOILET MISSION
The green toilet mission gave us a head start on the cleanliness campaign. As toilets are one of the places frequently used on the premises, It is crucial they are well-sanitised and hygienic. Posters and sign boards emphasising restroom norms were displayed all over the toilets. Bathroom fresheners, Trash bins, toilet brushes and sanitising liquids were placed and a sanitary pad extinguisher was also installed making it a secure and healthy environment for females.
CLEANLINESS IN CLASSROOM
Cleanliness checks were executed in classrooms and staff rooms on a weekly basis which were graded as per their tidiness through three colours red-poor maintenance, yellow for moderately clean and green symbolising immaculate maintenance. The assigned colours were recorded and the cleanest classroom/staff room was awarded a certificate and an eco-friendly classroom accessory crafted by the Dal designers. 
THE CLEANLINESS COLUMN
A shout-out board displaying the core undertakings, events and write-ups by the Dal members conveyed our earnest plea to quit littering. A creative horizon of articles, artworks, poems and short stories captured parents’ and students' attention towards the impact of clean surroundings. 
ON A HUMOROUS NOTE 
The Dal members and I staged a “Nukkad Natak” (street show) to popularise our mission. It was rather comical with our message being conveyed through a playful drama involving the cause-effect relation of littering. Performed in the streets, the play effectively highlighted the Swacch Bharat mission.
GARBAGE DIET
On the occasion of Literary Carnival, the Dal members once again came up with a play discussing the ill effects of garbage. Being the territory of bacteria, garbage is the root cause of cholera, tetanus, and diarrhoea which once shook the nation as the result of a deadly outbreak. 
REACHING OUT TO THE YOUNG
We paid a few visits to the local government schools to educate young students about the essence of health and hygiene. Toilet accessories were distributed to the students for personal sanitation. They were also engaged in quizzes about environmental issues and the winners received pleasantries and echo-friendly rewards. 
REDUCE, REUSE and RECYCLE
Being a green haven, our school holds profound waste management methods. Every month, students are engaged in crafting 
Safai ki sitare” (stars of cleanliness) was one activity wherein my teammates and I interviewed housekeeping staff of the school enquiring about their working hours, students and staffs cooperation
