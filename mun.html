             Having been to Model United Nations conferences, I have experienced what it is like to represent a country at an international forum. The magnificence of all the United Nations Bodies always continues to inspire and instil. 
Humanitarian committees like UNHRC, UNCSW and WHO have exposed me to the multitude of  hardships being faced by people across the world, while committees like UNGA-DISEC and UNSC made me well taught the importance of international relations and respect for the foreign policy of each nation of the world. Apart from building up public speaking and confidence, a Model UN would have a far-reaching impact. The crisis sessions at each conference strengthened my problem-solving skills and I find myself decisive. 
The executive board that moderated and gave feedback for each committee session has had an ever-lasting impact on my journey of building diplomacy. 
Yugen Summit 2021-22
Hosting the Yugen Summit 2021-22 was an experience too rewarding.
Residing as a co-vice chairperson for the UNGA-DISEC at the Model UN was one of the most exciting experiences I've had. Interacting with first-timers who were just starting out on their MUN journey was one of the highlights of this conference. It was my first time chairing a conference as well, which was surprisingly less intimidating than I had built it up in my head to be. It was fun to take the participants through the nuances of a MUN conference and help them to understand how diplomacy and rules at a MUN work. It was quite surprising to see the talent and poise with which the participants, who were only doing a MUN for the first time, conducted themselves.
The Gavel symbolises authority and holding it in my hand, tapping it across while moderating the committee, instilled an invigorating feeling in my mind. I felt the presence of responsibility in my chest. I was determined to play my part in making diplomacy matter. 

Furthermore, Securing members for the Executive Board was quite challenging. “The Indian Conclave”, a non-profit organisation served as the Event Partner for the Model UN and aided in work at the grass-root level. 
We had a Core Team which handled all the departments involved, along with conveying issues to the management. 
Yugen was popularised on an adequate scale and the outreach was implemented to increase the number of first-timers as well.  
A separate team was allocated the social media responsibility - creating posts and keeping engagement active. This was helpful in bringing in a lot of first-timers all over, to say. 
The entire expenditure of the MUN was dealt with in a staggered manner- all the accounts and transactions were regularly maintained to submit the same to the management. 
In line with the new policy of independent work, every team had the complete power of their requirements. There was no hierarchy in position in any form, in the organising committee. 
Two before the conference, an induction session was given to the delegates to make them well versed about the conference Rules of Procedure (ROP), and the flow of the committee. 
Heads of all Teams submitted weekly reports enumerating the progress of work, difficulties encountered, and feedback. This was in turn sent to the management, to take it into consideration.
