              The event of Gratitude Day received active funds making it the Student Councilâ€™s one of most successful fundraisers throughout our journey. We often fail to notice the importance of the role played by the non-teaching staff such as the housekeeping, motor drivers and other ground workers who work relentlessly each day. The council took the initiative to arrange and serve lunch to the department as a token of heartfelt gratitude for their toil. Besides, to let them have a day off, several fun activities were planned out - Rangoli Competition, Kite Flying and other games. 
Several review meets were conducted to keep track of the contributions. The total collections hit a net amount of rupees 48,000+. Moreover, with the surplus funds, we arranged small gifts for the staff as well. 
Students were widely encouraged to donate their share of funds and received tremendous cooperation from them. 
The non-teaching staff cherished the day and showered the council with blessings. It was a colourful sight.
