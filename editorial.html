            The newsletter was designed in a simple and minimalistic way so as to enable a person of any age group to easily comprehend. Though the acquisition of information and media from various departments was quite a task, we eased it by dividing the work among the team members. Over 500 write-ups were meticulously proofread by the team to tune the content and eliminate unimportant information. 

The text was kept concise and the pictures that were featured in each edition of the newsletter were handpicked to enhance the aesthetic factor thereby providing the readers with a seamless experience. Every week feedback was received from the Magazine committee to make sure we were on the right track. Modifications were  incorporated on a timely basis through review meetings conducted by the team. All suggested improvements were documented in the minute of the meeting so as to improve accessibility to all the editors on board. 

The newsletters were ratified by the principal each time they have undergone the process of publication. Working for the Magazine committee was an experience too important for me; I was able to strengthen my literal as well as leadership aspects while coordinating and organising tasks within the team.
